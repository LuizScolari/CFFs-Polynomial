# CFFs-Polynomial
Combinatorial designs, Polynomial CFFs.<br>
CFFs (Cover-Free Families) are combinatorial structures used in various fields such as cryptography, coding theory, and group testing. They represent collections of subsets where no subset is entirely covered by the union of others. The polynomial form refers to the way CFFs are constructed; these methods help optimize the size and structure of CFFs, making them more efficient for practical applications.


## ðŸ“š About this Project
The theory of combinatorial designs seeks to explore the possibility of arranging elements of a finite set into subsets such that certain "balance properties" are satisfied. The main problems explored consist of investigating the existence of designs with specific properties, which in turn have applications in various fields, including biology, software engineering, and cryptography. This project aims to explore combinatorial designs, their applications, and constructions. More precisely, the goal is to conceive new designs or generalizations of existing designs to better solve problems in the field of computer science in general, with a special focus on problems in cryptography.<br>
